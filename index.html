			<p>Anyone in the business industry will tell you that attracting and retaining clients/customers is one of the most complex, and at times costly, parts of running their business. It's very difficult to look at your store or office with an unbiased eye, or evaluate and understand what your customers are seeing/hearing when they speak to your staff. These are all critical components of the customer experience.</p>
			<p>You hear me repeating the term 'customer experience' because that's exactly what it should be, an experience that your customer will not only want to repeat, but will share with friends, family and colleagues. It can be smaller, subconscious things we may not even be aware of or more obvious things like a messy store or poor customer service.</p>
			<p>We want to ensure that each customer's experience is not only positive, but that the service and the sale are maximized. If our businesses are thriving, then our local economy is too. It means that our hard earned dollars are staying in the community we live in. Businesses that are doing well not only remain in the community, but contribute to it. It's a win/win experience.</p>
			<p>If you can't say that that's what is currently happening in your business, or even just have concerns about how your business is operating when you aren't there, give me a call or send me an email. I can help, and since this is my community too, I want to.</p> 

		  </div>
		  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="services">
		  <p></p>
			<p>We can meet in person, over the phone, skype, email, whatever works for you.</p>
			<p>Together we can figure out what exactly it is you need and how I can give it to you, as quickly, efficiently and helpfully as possible. I want your experience to be one that's so positive, you will happily refer fellow businesses, but is so successful, you never have to repeat. No matter what option we chose, you will always get a customized, written report outlining any suggestions, ideas or constructive feedback we have, doing our best to help you achieve your potential as a business owner!</p>
			<p>Some services include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Website and social media analysis ( Including writing or editing as required)</li>
				<li>Review of current advertising</li>
				<li>Client base analysis (are you attracting the people you want to your business? Do you know?)</li>
				<li>Analysis of the exterior experience (is it welcoming? Does it draw people in?)</li>
				<li>Hazard identification (areas where an accident could occur, opening you up to a liability claim)</li>
				<li>In store analysis (Is it welcoming? Is it too busy, or cluttered?)</li>
				<li>Review of facilities (Are your facilities clean? Do they smell/look/feel welcoming?)</li>
				<li>How does your staff represent the business? Are they professional? Do they engage with people? Do they miss opportunities to offer your clients additional services they may want?</li>
				<li>How do they handle a difficult customer/situation? This is so important! Everyone has a bad day, can be grumpy or frustrated and difficult or everyone runs out of a preferred item/time slot at some point. It's how a difficult situation is handled, ensuring your customer leaves the store happier then when they came in that sets apart the true customer service professional</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Born and raised in Ottawa, I truly love it here. Even in high school I was always working in the customer service industry, and I pride myself on the fact that I did it well. I left to attend Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, in 1996. I obtained my degree in Communication Studies (which encompasses communications, the media, marketing, psychology and business in a fascinating and engaging way). After University I travelled to Seoul, South Korea, where I taught English for almost three years. I loved the experience of engaging with my students, developing learning plans and embracing a totally different (though far more customer oriented) culture. When I returned to Canada, I worked in the Insurance Industry (obtaining my insurance licence) for a few years, in Sales & Service, writing and underwriting policies and providing superior customer service at every opportunity.</p>
			<p>My attention to detail, my unique education and experience combination, as well as my creativity make this something I'm not only good at, but I truly enjoy. I always share comments about my experience with a business, and if something has gone awry, I always ensure the person in charge is made aware, and in pretty much all cases, they address the issue. This is so important.</p>
			<p>I'm determined to ensure that every local business is doing their best in this difficult economy. I'll listen to and evaluate what you need and come up with something that will fit your budget. That's true customer care!</p>
